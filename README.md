A FIU project for Group 6 EGN
This project entailed the designing of a robot, both in the hardware and software aspects. For the Sumo Sweeper variant of the project, the robot was tasked with pushing styrofoam cups out of the black ring while staying within the bounds of the ring. This was done through specific hardware manipulations through the addition of cardboard sweeper arms as well as software instruction, allowing for the robot to recognize its boundary and the objects that are meant to be pushed out of the ring.
